{{< warning >}}
Currently, the TiKV client for C++ is not released yet.
{{< /warning >}}

The TiKV client for C++ is built on top of [TiKV client for Rust](https://github.com/tikv/client-rust) using [cxx](https://github.com/dtolnay/cxx).

This C++ client is still in the stage of prove-of-concept and under heavy development. You can track the development progress at the [tikv/client-cpp](https://github.com/tikv/client-cpp/) repository.
